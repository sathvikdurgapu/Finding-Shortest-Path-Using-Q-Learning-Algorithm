# Finding-Shortest-Path-Using-Q-Learning-Algorithm

In this project. the shortest path in the graph is calculated using Q-Learning Algorithm.

Q-learning is a model-free, off-policy reinforcement learning that will find the best course of action, given the current state of the agent. Depending on where the agent is in the environment, it will decide the next action to be taken.
